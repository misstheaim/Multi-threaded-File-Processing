Ideas don’t wait for permission.
Thoughts collide, forming patterns in motion.
Every sentence opens a door.
Meaning lives between the lines.
Creation thrives on curiosity and bold starts.
Blank pages are never truly empty.
Writing shapes the unseen.
Purpose grows word by word.
Silence ends — with expression p p.
